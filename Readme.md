This project contains my personal analysis of the data dump from my [Basis B1 Band][1]. This model has since been replaced with the [Basis Peak][2]. Basis did not offer [access to the data][3] collected by their products until [January of 2015][4]. This new data feature is somewhat limited as you can only access through their new phone application and not through their web interface. Due to this limited access "portal" and the fact that the Basis Peak app is not compatible with my B1 device,  I decided to use a PHP script written by a previous Basis user that was stored on [Github][5].

This repository will store the code I used to analyze my Basis Data and various reports that will summarize my findings as I explore it.
